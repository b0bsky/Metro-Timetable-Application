# Metro-Timetable-Application

## What is this project
Our aim in this project is to create a simple and intuitive UI (user interface) in python, to interact with a database to help users to:
- Find individual bus timetables
- Plan a trip
- See where a bus will be at a certain time
- See when a bus will arrive at a certain stop
- Find the right bus based on the users destination and/or location
